THE CENTRAL FUNCTION DXRS IN THIS PROJECT ARE INSTALLED SOLELY AS AN ACCESS POINT FOR THE FLN TO LOG INTO THE FLOOR DXR CONTROLLERS, LOAD APPLICATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOT EASILY FROM THE MECHANICAL ROOMS.

IN THE FUTURE THE CENTRAL FUNCTION DXR CAN BE USED TO GATHER DATA FROM OTHER DXRS ON ITS FLN, IT CAN THEN BE USED AS A SINGLE REFERENCE POINT FOR SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE RESETS, SUPPLY AIR STATIC PRESSURE RESETS, ETC.
