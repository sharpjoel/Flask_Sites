INTERNAL CONTROLLER SEQUENCE:
FCU 4-PIPE CW AND HW VALVES APPLICATION TEMPLATE 14051. THE CONTROLLER MODULATES SEPARATE HEATING COIL VALVE (HCLVLVPOS) AND COOLING COIL VALVE (CCLVLVPOS) IN THE FAN COIL UNIT TO MAINTAIN ROOM TEMPERATURE HEATING SETPOINT (SPH) AND COOLING SETPOINT (SPC). THE FAN COIL UNIT ALSO HAS A FAN (FAN1SPD) TO CIRCULATE ROOM AIR. 

THE INTERNAL SEQUENCE WILL OPERATE THE UNIT PER THE CONTRACT SEQUENCE SHOWN BELOW.

FAN COIL UNIT â€“ (FROM DRAWING M4.04)

OCCUPIED MODE: SWITCH TO OCCUPIED MODE BASED ON CUSTOMER PROVIDED OCCUPIED / UNOCCUPIED SCHEDULE.
	SA FAN: START AND REMAIN ON


OCCUPIED MODE: SWITCH TO UNOCCUPIED MODE BASED ON CUSTOMER PROVIDED OCCUPIED / UNOCCUPIED SCHEDULE.
	SA FAN: STOP; CYCLE ON/OFF TO MAINTAIN SETBACK TEMPERATURE SET POINTS

ZONE SET POINTS: RESET ZONE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY SET POINTS

OCCUPIED MODE:
COOLING=74 DEG F (+/- 2 DEG F OCCUPANT ADJUSTMENT)
HEATING=70 DEG F (+/- 2 DEG F OCCUPANT ADJUSTMENT)
HUMIDITY=60%
OPEN OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER, WHERE APPLICABLE.

UNOCCUPIED MODE:
COOLING=OCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT +/- 4 DEG F
HEATING=OCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT +/- 4 DEG F
HUMIDITY=65%
CLOSE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER, WHERE APPLICABLE.

COOLING MODE: MODULATE COOLING COIL CONTROL VALVE TO MAINTAIN ZONE TEMPERATURE COOLING SET POINT. CLOSE AND DISABLE VALVE WHEN IN HEATING MODE.

HEATING MODE: MODULATE RE-HEATING COIL CONTROL VALVE TO MAINTAIN ZONE TEMPERATURE HEATING SET POINT. CLOSE AND DISABLE VALVE WHEN IN COOLING MODE.

DEHUMIDIFICATION: OPEN COOLING CONTROL VALVE TO MAINTAIN ZONE DEHUMIDIFICATION SET POINT. MODULATE RE-HEATING COIL CONTROL VALVE TO MAINTAIN ZONE TEMPERATURE SET POINT.

OVERRIDE MODE:  SWITCH TO OCCUPIED MODE BASED ON BAS OPERATOR COMMAND OR MANUAL ACTIVATION OF ANY ONE OVERRIDE SWITCH ON A ZONE TEMPERATURE SENSOR. SWITCH TO OCCUPIED / UNOCCUPIED MODE WHEN OVERRIDE TIME EXPIRES BASED ON OCCUPIED/UNOCCUPIED SCHEDULE. OVERRIDE MODE DURATION SHALL BE 3 HOURS (ADJ.)

CONDENSATE LEVEL SHUTDOWN CONTROL: SHUTDOWN UNIT AND ALARM BAS WHEN CONDENSATE DRAIN PAN HIGH-LEVEL SWITCH INDICATES HIGH-LEVEL. CLOSE COOLING COIL VALVE AND SEND AN ALARM.

MONITOR AND TREND:
FAN STATUS CHANGES BY CURRENT SENSING RELAY
FAN RUN TIMES
SA AND SPACE TEMPERATURES (15 MIN. INTERVALS)
SPACE TEMPERATURE SET POINT CHANGES
SPACE HUMIDITY (15 MIN. INTERVALS)
COIL CONTROL VALVE POSITIONS (5 MIN. INTERVALS)

ALARMS:
SA FAN FAILURES
SA TEMPERATURE FAILS TO MEET SET POINT WITHIN 30 MIN.
FIRE ALARM SHUTDOWN
HIGH CONDENSATE ALARM.
