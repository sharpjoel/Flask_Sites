CHILLED WATER - CONTROL SEQUENCE

GENERAL
CHILLED WATER SYSTEM PROVIDES VARIABLE CHILLED WATER FLOW AND CONSTANT PRESSURE TO BUILDING. SYSTEM CONSIST OF AVARIABLE FLOW CHILLED WATER PIPING LOOP. EACH CHILLED WATER PUMP IS SIZED FOR 100% LOAD. PUMPS ARE DESIGNED FOR PRIMARY/REDUNDANT OPERATION.
ACTIVATE START UP SEQUENCE UPON OPERATOR INPUT, WHEN ANY SINGLE CHILLED WATER VALVE IS COMMANDED OPEN.
ACTIVATE SHUT DOWN SEQUENCE UPON OPERATOR INPUT OR WHEN ALL CHILLED WATER VALVES ARE COMMANDED CLOSED.

START UP

UPON START COMMAND

BUILDING SUPPLY ISOLATION VALVE OPENS
TEMPERATURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES
BUILDING SUPPLY TEMPERATURE RESET CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES
DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES
DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE RESET CONTROL SEQUENCE ENABLES
MINIMUM WATER FLOW CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES
LEAD PUMP STARTS AND IS PROVEN
PUMP ROTATION SEQUENCE ACTIVATES

SHUT DOWN

UPON SHUT DOWN COMMAND

PUMPS STOP
BUILDING SUPPLY ISOLATION VALVE CLOSES
MINIMUM FLOW BYPASS VALVE CLOSES
BUILDING RETURN VALVE CLOSES
ALL OTHER SEQUENCES DISABLE
SUPPRESS NUISANCE ALARMS

DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CONTROL:
STAGE PUMPS ON AND OFF BASED ON LOAD.

AS BUILDING DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE RISES ABOVE SETPOINT:

LEAD PUMP VFD SPEED DECREASES. MINIMUM VFD SPEED SHALL BE 15 HERTZ (ADJ).
WHEN THE LEAD PUMP IS ON AND IS OPERATING AT 15 HERTZ (ADJ) FOR A PERIOD OF 3 MINUTES (ADJ), STAGE LEAD PUMP OFF.
AFTER STAGING LEAD PUMP OFF, OPEN PUMP BYPASS VALVE.

AS BUILDING DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE FALLS BELOW SETPOINT, THE FOLLOWING OCCURS:

CLOSE PUMP BYPASS VALVE.
LEAD PUMP TURNS ON AND VFD SHALL RAMP UP TO 15 HERTZ (ADJ). ONCE PUMP IS PROVEN, SPEED INCREASES TO MAINTAIN BUILDING DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SETPOINT

DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE RESET CONTROL:

RESET SEQUENCE IS ONLY ACTIVE WHEN BUILDING SUPPLY TEMPERATURE SETPOINT IS AT MAXIMUM.
2. PERFORM EVERY 15 MINUTES (ADJ)
3. IF ANY VALVE COMMAND IS GREATER THAN 90% (ADJ), INCREASE PRESSURE SETPOINT BY 0.1 PSID
4. IF ALL VALVE COMMANDS ARE LESS THAN 80% (ADJ), DECREASE THE PRESSURE SETPOINT BY 0.1 PSID

MINIMUM WATER FLOW CONTROL:
AS WATER FLOW DECREASES BELOW MINIMUM FLOW SETPOINT, THE MINIMUM FLOW BYPASS VALVE MODULATES OPEN.
2. AS WATER RISES ABOVE MINIMUM FLOW SETPOINT, THE MINIMUM FLOW BYPASS VALVE MODULATES CLOSED.

PUMP ROTATION:
UPON ROTATION COMMAND, ONCE PER WEEK (ADJ) OR UPON OPERATOR INPUT:

DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CONTROL SEQUENCE REMAINS ACTIVE
STANDBY PUMP GRADUALLY RAMPS UP TO 20 HERTZ (ADJ) AND HOLDS
LEAD PUMP GRADUALLY RAMPS DOWN AND TURNS OFF
LEAD/STANDBY DESIGNATIONS ROTATE AND ARE ASSIGNED IN ORDER OF RUN HOURS. THE PUMP WITH THE LOWEST NUMBER OF RUN HOURS SHALL BE DESIGNATED AS THE LEAD PUMP.

UPON FAILURE OF THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE TRANSMITTER IN THE SECONDARY LOOP, DISTRIBUTION PUMPS SHALL BE CONTROLLED TO LAST KNOWN SPEED.

EMERGENCY POWER:
ONLY ONE PUMP SHALL BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE DURING A NORMAL POWER FAILURE. THE USER SHALL BE ABLE TO SELECT WHICH PUMP OPERATES DURING A NORMAL POWER FAILURE, AND THE REMAINING PUMP SHALL NOT BE ALLOWED TO START DURING A NORMAL POWER FAILURE.
