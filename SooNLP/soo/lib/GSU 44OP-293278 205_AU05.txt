AU-06 SEQUENCE OF OPERATION

1.	AU-06 SHALL BE NORMALLY STARTED AND STOPPED BY THE DDC SYSTEM DURING THE OCCUPIED AND UNOCCUPIED MODES AND SHALL BE PROGRAMMED FOR THE SAME SCHEDULE AS EXISTING AU-11.  PROVIDE FLN FEEDBACK TO VERIFY FAN OPERATION.  AIR UNIT VOLUME SHALL BE ADJUSTED BY VARYING THE SPEED OF THE VFD AT THE DRIVE.  IF THE OUTSIDE AIR TEMPERATURE IS BELOW 36°F, PROVIDE A TIME DELAY BETWEEN THE STARTING OF THE SUPPLY AIR FAN AND THE OPENING OF THE SMOKE DAMPER AND CONTROL DAMPERS IN THE OUTSIDE AIR DUCT ASSOCIATED WITH AU-06.  THE SUPPLY AIR FAN SHALL BE PROVED ON VIA AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT TRANSDUCER SWITCH PRIOR TO OPENING THE SMOKE AND CONTROL DAMPER IN THE OUTSIDE AIR DUCT.

2.	THE SYSTEM SHALL BE MANUALLY STARTED AND STOPPED FROM THE HAND AND OFF POSITION OF THE HAND OFF AUTO SWITCH AT THE ASSOCIATED VFD AND AUTOMATICALLY STARTED AND STOPPED BY THE DDC SYSTEM WHEN THE SWITCH IS IN THE AUTO POSITION.  ALL SAFETY DEVICES SHALL OPERATE WITH THE SWITCH IN THE HAND AND AUTO POSITION. AN EMERGENCY FAN STOP SWITCH SHALL SHUT DOWN THE UNIT WHEN ACTIVATED.  

3.	IN THE EVENT OF POWER INTERRUPTION OR SHUTDOWN OF THE SUPPLY AIR FAN, THE SMOKE DAMPER AND THE CONTROL DAMPERS IN THE ASSOCIATED OUTSIDE AIR INTAKE DUCTS AND EXHAUST AIR DUCTS SHALL BE CLOSED AND THE CHILLED WATER CONTROL VALVE SHALL BE CLOSED.  AIR UNITS SHALL BE PROGRAMMED FOR AUTO RESTART AFTER POWER FAILURE.

4.	DUCT MOUNTED SMOKE DETECTORS
A. 	SMOKE DETECTORS IN THE SUPPLY AIR, OUTSIDE AIR OR EXHAUST AIR DUCTS ASSOCIATED WITH AU-06 SHALL SHUT DOWN AU-06 WHEN AN ABNORMAL CONDITION EXISTS AT THE SMOKE DETECTORS.

B.	AU-06 SHALL BE INTERLOCKED WITH THE FIRE ALARM SYSTEM RELAY MOUNTED AT THE VFD TO CLOSE SMOKE DAMPERS AND SHUTDOWN THE AIR UNIT WHEN AN ABNORMAL CONDITION EXISTS AT ANY OF THE FLOOR PLAN AREAS SERVED BY THIS AIR UNIT. 

5.	A DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SWITCH SHALL MONITOR THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE ACROSS THE BANK OF FILTERS AND PROVIDE A CHANGE FILTER TROUBLE IDENTIFICATION IF THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE EXCEEDS 0.60 INCHES (ADJUSTABLE) OF WATER GAUGE.

6.	LOW TEMPERATURE DETECTOR THERMOSTATS EACH WITH A CAPILLARY LINE SET AT 38°F AND SENSING THE COLDEST PORTION OF AIR ENTERING THE CHILLED WATER COIL SHALL EXTEND ACROSS THE FACE OF THE COOLING COIL AND SHALL SHUT DOWN THE SUPPLY AIR FAN IF THIS LOW TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS EXISTS AND PROVIDE AN AUXILIARY ALARM SIGNAL TO THE DDC SYSTEM.

7.	A SEPARATE, AVERAGING DDC TYPE TEMPERATURE SENSOR SENSING THE COLDEST PORTION OF AIR ENTERING THE COOLING COIL SHALL BE PROVIDED.  IF THE UNIT IS ON OR OFF AND THE AIR TEMPERATURE AT THIS LOCATION IS 42°F OR LESS, THEN A REMOTE ALARM SHALL BE PROVIDED AND THE SUPPLY AIR FAN SHALL BE STARTED IF IT IS IN THE UNOCCUPIED MODE WITH THE SMOKE DAMPER AND THE CONTROL DAMPERS IN THE OUTSIDE AIR INTAKE DUCTS CLOSED, THE SUPPLY AIR FAN SHALL RUN FOR A MINIMUM OF FIVE (5) MINUTES (ADJUSTABLE) IN THIS MODE.

8.	THE POSITION OF THE CHILLED WATER CONTROL VALVE SHALL BE MODULATED TO MAINTAIN A COLD DECK LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE OF 54°F IF ANY ZONE TEMPERATURE SENSOR IS CALLING FOR COOLING OR IF THE ROOM RELATIVE HUMIDITY IS ABOVE 60%.

9.	EACH RESPECTIVE ZONE TEMPERATURE SENSOR SHALL MODULATE ITS ASSOCIATED COLD DECK/VENTILATION DECK DAMPERS TO MAINTAIN ROOM TEMPERATURE SETPOINT.   WHEN A ZONE TEMPERATURE SENSOR IS CALLING FOR FULL COOLING, ITS ASSOCIATED COLD DECK DAMPER SHALL BE FULL OPEN AND VENTILATION DECK DAMPER FULL CLOSED.  UPON A FALL IN DEMAND FOR COOLING, THE COLD DECK DAMPER SHALL BE MODULATED CLOSED AND THE VENTILATION DECK DAMPER MODULATED OPEN, RESPECTIVELY.  UPON NO CALL FOR COOLING, THE COLD DECK DAMPER SHALL BE CLOSED AND THE VENTILATION DECK DAMPER OPEN.  UPON A CALL FOR HEATING THE VENTILATION DECK DAMPER SHALL REMAIN OPEN WITH THE COLD DECK DAMPER CLOSED.  EACH ZONE TEMPERATURE SENSOR SHALL HAVE A COOLING TEMPERATURE SETPOINT AND A HEATING TEMPERATURE SETPOINT WITH AN (ADJUSTABLE) DEADBAND BETWEEN SETPOINTS.

10.	WHEN THE SUPPLY AIR FAN IS ON AND RUNNING NORMALLY AND IF THE RELATIVE HUMIDITY SETPOINT AT THE ASSOCIATED ROOM RELATIVE HUMIDITY SENSOR FALLS TO 30 % (ADJUSTABLE), AND THERE IS NO CALL FOR COOLING BY ANY ROOM TEMPERATURE SENSOR, THE FIRST STAGE OF THE SPRAY TYPE HUMIDIFIER SHALL BE ON.  IF THE ROOM RELATIVE HUMIDITY AT ANY ONE SENSOR FALLS TO THE MINIMUM SETPOINT OF 25% (ADJUSTABLE), THE SECOND STAGE OF THE SPRAY TYPE HUMIDIFIER SHALL BE ON.  THE SEQUENCE SHALL BE REVERSED WHEN THE RESPECTIVE ROOM RELATIVE HUMIDITY SENSOR SETPOINT IS SATISFIED, OR IF THE AIR UNIT MOUNTED RELATIVE HUMIDITY LIMITING SENSOR LOCATED AT THE DISCHARGE OF THE COLD DECK REACHES ITS HIGH LIMIT OF 85% RH SETPOINT (ADJUSTABLE), OR IF THE AIR UNIT IS OFF, OR IF THE ROOM RELATIVE HUMIDITY SENSOR EXCEEDS ITS MAXIMUM SETPOINT OF 55% RH (ADJUSTABLE).

11.	THE ASSOCIATED ZONE TEMPERATURE SENSORS SHALL OVERRIDE THE OFF SIGNAL OF THE DDC SYSTEM FOR AU-06 AND ALLOW THE AIR UNIT TO RUN WITH THE SMOKE DAMPER AND CONTROL DAMPERS IN THE OUTSIDE AIR INTAKE DUCT CLOSED IF ANY ONE ZONE TEMPERATURE FALLS TO 55°F (ADJUSTABLE) OR INCREASES TO 85°F (ADJUSTABLE) DURING THE UNOCCUPIED MODE.  DURING THIS UNOCCUPIED MODE, THE AIR UNIT SHALL RUN UNTIL ALL SENSORS ARE SATISFIED EXCEPT THAT THE FAN SHALL RUN FOR A MINIMUM OF FIVE (5) MINUTES (ADJUSTABLE). EXISTING CONTROLS FOR AIR ECONOMIZER DAMPERS SHALL BE DISCONNECTED AND REMOVED.


E.	ELECTRIC DUCT HEATERS
1.	THE RESPECTIVE ROOM TEMPERATURE SENSOR ASSOCIATED WITH AN ELECTRIC DUCT HEATER SHALL CYCLE ON THE STAGES OF THE ELECTRIC HEATING COIL TO MAINTAIN THE ROOM TEMPERATURE HEATING SETPOINT FOR BOTH THE OCCUPIED AND UNOCCUPIED SETPOINTS (ADJUSTABLE) IF THE CONTROLS SYSTEM HAS MODULATED THE ZONE DAMPER ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESPECTIVE ELECTRIC DUCT HEATER TO THE FULLY CLOSED TO THE COLD DECK AND FULLY OPEN TO THE VENT DECK AT THE ASSOCIATED AIR HANDLING UNIT AND THE AIR HANDLING UNIT FAN IS PROVED ON VIA  ITS ELECTRICAL TRANSDUCER SWITCH.  PROVIDE A TIME DELAY (ADJUSTABLE) BETWEEN ENERGIZING AND DE-ENERGIZING EACH STAGE OF ELECTRIC HEAT.

2.	IF THE ZONE TEMPERATURE FALLS 5°F (ADJUSTABLE) BELOW SETPOINT DURING OCCUPIED HOURS, A TROUBLE ALARM SHALL BE SENT TO THE CENTRAL SITE.

3.	THE RESPECTIVE ELECTRIC DUCT HEATER SHALL BE OFF IN THE INTERNAL SAFETIES OF THE ELECTRIC DUCT HEATER DETECT AN ABNORMAL CONDITION.


F.	OUTSIDE AND EXHAUST AIRFLOW MONITORING STATIONS
1.	THE OUTSIDE AND EXHAUST AIRFLOW MONITORING STATIONS SHALL EACH MONITOR THE AIRFLOW IN THE RESPECTIVE OUTSIDE OR EXHAUST AIR DUCTS AND PROVIDE A 4-20 MAMP OUTPUT IN PROPORTION TO THE AIRFLOW

2.	THE ASSOCIATED OUTSIDE OR EXHAUST AIR CONTROL DAMPER SHALL BE MODULATED TO MAINTIN THE OUTSIDE OR EXHAUST AIRFLOW SETPOINT FOR THE AIRFLOW MONITORING STATION

3.	IF THE OUTSIDE OR EXHAUST AIR FALLS BELOW AND STAYS BELOW THE ASSOCIATED OUTSIDE OR EXHAUST AIRFLOW SETPOINT FOR A PRESET (ADJUSTABLE) LENGTH OF TIME, AN ALARM SHALL BE SENT TO THE CENTRAL SITE.


G.	FIRE/SMOKE AND SMOKE DAMPERS
1.	EACH FIRE/SMOKE AND SMOKE DAMPER SHALL BE INTERLOCKED WITH ITS ASSOCIATED FIRE ALARM RELAY SUCH THAT UPON DETECTION OF AN ABNORMAL CONDITION BY THE UNITS DUCT MOUNTED SMOKE DETECTORS, THE FIRE/SMOKE OR SMOKE DAMPER SHALL CLOSE

2.	ALL FIRE/SMOKE AND SMOKE DAMPERS SHALL BE INTERLOCKED TO CLOSE UPON RECEIPT OF AN ALARM SIGNAL FROM THE FIRE ALARM SYSTEM FIRE RELAY MOUNTED WITHIN 3 FEET OF THE AU VFD ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRE/SMOKE AND/OR SMOKE DAMPERS AND THE CORRESPONDING AIR HANDLING UNIT.
