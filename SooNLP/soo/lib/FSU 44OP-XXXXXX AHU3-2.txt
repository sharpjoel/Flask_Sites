SYSTEM SHALL OPERATE CONTINUOUSLY (24 HOURS PER DAY, 365 DAYS PER YEAR).

START UP:

1. UPON START UP COMMAND:

OUTSIDE AIR ISOLATION DAMPER SHALL OPEN AND BE PROVEN.
SUPPLY FAN VFD SHALL START SUPPLY FANS; VFD AND EACH FAN SHALL BE PROVEN.
SUPPLY FAN STATIC PRESSURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
SUPPLY DUCT STATIC PRESSURE RESET ACTIVATES.
PREHEAT COIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
COOLING COIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE RESET SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.

SHUTDOWN:

1. UPON SHUTDOWN COMMAND:

ALL SUPPLY FANS SHALL STOP AND BE PROVEN BY CURRENT SENSING DEVICES.
ALL ASSOCIATED DAMPERS IN SYSTEM SHALL CLOSE.
ALL OTHER SEQUENCES DISABLE.
NUISANCE ALARMS ARE SUPPRESSED.

SUPPLY FAN STATIC PRESSURE CONTROL:

1. VFD CONTROLS THE SUPPLY FAN SPEED.

2. SUPPLY FAN VFD SPEED MODULATES TO MAINTAIN SUPPLY DUCT STATIC PRESSURE
SETPOINT.

SUPPLY DUCT STATIC PRESSURE RESET:

1. PERFORM EVERY 15 MINUTES (ADJ)

2. IF ANY VAV BOX DAMPER COMMAND IS GREATER THAN 90% (ADJ), INCREASE DUCT
STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT BY 0.1 IN.WG.

3. IF ALL VAV BOX DAMPER COMMANDS ARE LESS THAN 60% (ADJ), DECREASE DUCT
STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT BY 0.1 IN.WG.

PREHEAT COIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL:

1. PREHEAT COIL VALVE MODULATES TO MAINTAIN PREHEAT COIL LEAVING AIR
TEMPERATURE SETPOINT.

COOLING COIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL:

1. COOLING COIL VALVE MODULATES TO MAINTAIN COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR
SETPOINT.

2. COOLING COIL VALVE SHALL REMAIN CLOSED ANY TIME THAT THE PREHEAT
COIL VALVE IS OPEN.

COOLING COIL TEMPERATURE RESET CONTROL:

1. RESET SEQUENCE IS ONLY ACTIVE WHEN STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT IS AT
MINIMUM.

2. RESET THE COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE SETPOINT BASED ON
THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE:
50% (ADJ) OF THE ZONES SERVED HAVE A REHEAT VALVE COMMAND AT 75% (ADJ) OR HIGHER: INCREASE LAT 1 DEG F EVERY 10 MINUTES (ADJ) UNTIL75% (ADJ) OF ZONE REHEAT COIL COMMANDS ARE BELOW 65% (ADJ).
75% (ADJ) OF THE ZONES SERVED HAVE A REHEAT VALVE COMMAND AT 25% (ADJ) OR LOWER: DECREASE LAT 1 DEG F EVERY 10 MINUTES (ADJ) UNTIL 50% (ADJ) OF ZONE REHEAT COIL COMMANDS ARE ABOVE 35% (ADJ).

3. COOLING COIL TEMPERATURE RESET STOPS WHEN ANY ZONE HUMIDITY
SENSOR MEASURES 50% RH OR GREATER.

LEAD/STANDBY ROTATION FOR PRIMARY/REDUNDANT VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVES:

1. AUTOMATICALLY ROTATE LEAD/STANDBY DESIGNATIONS FOR DRIVE A AND
DRIVE B EACH WEEK TO EQUALIZE RUN TIME.

2. LEAD/STANDBY ROTATION SHALL PROVIDE SEAMLESS TRANSITION FROM DRIVE
A TO DRIVE B WITHOUT ANY LOSS OF AIR FLOW.

3. OPERATOR SHALL BE ABLE TO MANUALLY OVERRIDE LEAD/STANDBY
DESIGNATIONS.

SAFETIES:

1. IF THE PREHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE IS 100% OPEN AND THE LEAVING AIR
TEMPERATURE IS 38 DEG F OR LESS (ADJ), COOLING COIL CONTROL VALVE
SHALL MODULATE TO 100% (ADJ) OPEN.

2. THE FOLLOWING SAFETIES SHUT DOWN SUPPLY FAN AND ACTIVATE SHUT
DOWN SEQUENCE:
LOW TEMPERATURE LIMIT SWITCH
LOW STATIC PRESSURE LIMIT SWITCH
HIGH STATIC PRESSURE LIMIT SWITCH
DRAIN PAN FLOAT SWITCH ALARM

3. SYSTEM SHALL CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN NORMAL MODE IF THE BUILDING
FIRE ALARM IS ACTIVATED.

4. UPON ACTIVATION DUCT SMOKE DETECTOR ASSOCIATED WITH THE AIR
HANDLING UNIT, ACTIVATE SHUTDOWN SEQUENCE.

DATA ANALYTICS

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING FAULTS ARE PROVEN TRUE AT ANY TIME, THE BAS SHALL ISSUE A FAULT REPORT TO THE BAS WORKSTATION STATING THE FAULT NAME AND THE VALUE OF ALL ASSOCIATED BAS POINTS

1. COOLING COIL CONTROL VALVE LEAKING FAULT - COOLING COIL CONTROL VALVE IS
COMMANDED CLOSED (0%) AND COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE IS 4 DEG
F (ADJ) BELOW PREHEAT COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE.

2. LOW CHILLED WATER FLOW FAULT - COOLING COIL CONTROL VALVE IS COMMANDED
OPEN (100%) AND COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE IS 2 DEG F (ADJ)
ABOVE SETPOINT.

3. SUPPLY DUCT STATIC PRESSURE RESET FAULT - ALL VAV BOX COMMANDS ARE LESS
THAN 60% (ADJ) AND DUCT STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT IS ABOVE STATIC
PRESSURE MINIMUM SETPOINT.

4. COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE RESET FAULT - 50% (ADJ) OF THE ZONES
HAVE A REHEAT COMMAND AT 75% (ADJ) OR HIGHER AND SUPPLY AIR
TEMPERATURE SETPOINT IS BELOW SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE MAXIMUM
SETPOINT.

5. SUPPLY DUCT STATIC PRESSURE RESET - VAV BOX FAULT - IF ONE VAV BOX DAMPER
COMMAND IS GREATER THAN 90% (ADJ) AND ALL OTHER VAV BOX DAMPER
COMMANDS ARE LESS THAN 60%.

6. COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE SENSOR FAULT - COOLING COIL LEAVING
AIR TEMPERATURE IS 2 DEG F (ADJ) ABOVE PREHEAT COIL LEAVING AIR
TEMPERATURE.

7. SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE SENSOR FAULT - SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE SENSOR IS
0 DEG F (ADJ) BELOW OR 5 DEG F (ADJ) ABOVE COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR
TEMPERATURE.

8. SUPPLY AIR STATIC PRESSURE - AFTER FAN SENSOR FAULT - SUPPLY AIR STATIC
PRESSURE - 2/3 IN DUCT IS 0.0 IN WG (ADJ) ABOVE SUPPLY AIR STATIC PRESSURE -
AFTER FAN.

9. SUPPLY AIRFLOW FAULT - SUPPLY FAN SPEED COMMAND IS 100% AND STATIC
