LAB ENVELOPE: 4 SUPPLY, 4 GENERAL EXHAUST. 

THE INTENT IS FOR TYPICAL DXR-1 AND DXR-2 SEGMENTS TO OPERATE IN SYNC, HOWEVER CONSIDER INDIVIDUAL SPACE REQUIREMENTS (FOR EXAMPLE, IF LAB A IS PHYSICALLY ISOLATED FROM LAB B)

THE EXISTING TO REMAIN OA DAMPERS ARE MANUAL, NO CONTROL SCOPE.

LAB AIR TERMINAL CONTROL SEQUENCE – CV – EXISTING SPACE

GENERAL
EXISTING LABS ARE CONSTANT VOLUME. AIR TERMINALS ON SUPPLY AND EXHAUST WILL
MODULATE TO MAINTAIN CONSTANT FLOW SETPOINTS. SPACE TEMPERATURE IS
MONITORED BY A SPACE TEMPERATURE SENSOR. REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE
MODULATES TO MAINTAIN SPACE TEMPERATURE.

OCCUPIED MODE:
UPON OCCUPIED COMMAND VIA AIR HANDLING UNIT SCHEDULE:

- ACTIVATE OCCUPIED TEMPERATURE SETPOINTS.
- MAINTAIN CONSTANT AIR FLOW SETPOINTS.

UNOCCUPIED MODE:
UPON UNOCCUPIED COMMAND VIA AIR HANDLING UNIT SCHEDULE:

-  ACTIVATE UNOCCUPIED TEMPERATURE SETPOINTS.
-  MAINTAIN CONSTANT AIR FLOW SETPOINTS.

AIRFLOW CONTROL AND TEMPERATURE CONTROL:
REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN SPACE TEMPERATURE
SETPOINT. SUPPLY AIR TERMINAL SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN CONSTANT AIRFLOW
SETPOINT.

FUME EXHAUST AIR TERMINAL SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN CONSTANT AIRFLOW
SETPOINT.

ALARMS:
GENERATE ALARM IF SUPPLY AIR DAMPER COMMAND IS AT 100% AND SUPPLY AIRFLOW
DOES NOT MEET SETPOINT.
SETPOINTS:
UNOCCUPIED SPACE COOLING SETPOINT SHALL BE 80 DEGREES (ADJ) AND UNOCCUPIED SPACE HEATING SETPOINT SHALL BE 65 DEGREES (ADJ).

MAXIMUM SPACE DEWPOINT LIMIT SHALL BE 56 DEGREES (ADJ).
