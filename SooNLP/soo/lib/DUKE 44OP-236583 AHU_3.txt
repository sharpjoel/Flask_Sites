DEDICATED OUTSIDE AIR HANDLING UNITS (AHU-1, AHU-2 & AHU-3) - CONTROL SEQUENCE) -(PER SPEC 230993.3.8)

A.	General:
1.	System is designed as a variable volume dedicated outside air system.
2.	System is designed to supply conditioned outside air to all areas of the building.
3.	System has supply fan array.
4.	Unit is designed to handle the full latent load of the building by supplying outside air at a dew point much lower than the space set point.  This takes the entire latent load for the outside air and allows the conditioned outside air to absorb space latent load before being exhausted from the building.  Dehumidification downstream of the cooling coil is an integral part of this system.
5.	System shall use the campus global Outdoor air temperature for all instances of outdoor air. In the case that the global outdoor air temperature point fails use the local OAT sensor in the AHU ductwork.
6.	There shall be a Clear all virtual point located on the graphic that allows the user to restart the unit after shutdown by safety or maintenance.
B.	Unit Operating Mode:
1.	System shall operate continually with constant leaving air set point at all times unless shut down through the BAS.
2.	Building automation system will program time initiated functions and other items as specified.
3.	Control Contractor shall provide all necessary devices such as relays required for interface.
C.	Unit Operation:
1.	Unit operation shall be automatic and activated through building automation system.
2.	Current sensing shall be used to prove fan operation.  Failure of the supply or exhaust fan(s) shall result in an alarm activated through BAS.  If a supply fan is signaled to start and fan does not start within 20 seconds (adj) of start command, or if operating fan fails based on motor current switch, or if VFD fails, respective fan shall be de-energized and an alarm shall be generated through the BAS.  The failed fan(s) shall remain locked out until manually reset through the BAS.
D.	Interlocking:
1.	Lab exhaust fans shall be interlocked via software with respective air handling unit supply fan array so that the exhaust fans operate whenever interlocked supply fans operate and operate at reduced speed whenever interlocked supply fans stop.
2.	Interlock associated humidifier so that humidifier will be inoperative when any of the following conditions occur:
a.	Unit supply fans are not operating
b.	Unit is operating in cooling mode and control valve on cooling coil is open.
c.	Average space relative humidity is above 40% (adj).
3.	Humidifier interlock to supply fan shall be accomplished by utilizing both electrical interlock with supply fan and input signal from flow sensor on supply fan inlet.
4.	When starting a single AHU, interlock smoke/isolation damper on unit supply air discharge and the isolation damper on the outside air intake with the supply fans so that the fans do not start until the dampers are proven open by a limit switch.  Damper shall open when the associated fans are commanded to start and close when associated fans are signaled to stop.  Damper closing rate shall be adjustable and set so that fans are stopped prior to complete closure of dampers.
5.	When one or more AHUs are already operating, interlock smoke/isolation damper on unit outside air intake with the supply fans so that the fans do not start until the damper is proven open by a limit switch. Interlock smoke/isolation damper on the unit supply air discharge with the supply fans so that the damper does not open until the supply fans are started and operating at 25 Hz (adj). Exact speed to be determined during commissioning and TAB.
E.	System Air Volume Control:
1.	Unit supply fan and exhaust fans are furnished with variable frequency drives to maintain constant supply duct pressure and adjust the volume to match the building airflow demand.
2.	Fans shall always start at low speed.  On failure of fan volume control signal, fans shall go to low speed and an alarm shall be signaled through the BAS.
3.	Supply fans speed shall be modulated in parallel from common signal based on system static pressure. Unless otherwise shown on drawings, locate static pressure sensors in main supply duct two-thirds downstream from supply fan.  On a drop in static pressure below setpoint as measured by the pressure sensor/transmitter, the speed of the supply fans shall increase simultaneously and in parallel until static pressure setpoint has been satisfied.  On a rise in static pressure above setpoint, the speed of the supply fans shall decrease simultaneously and in parallel until the setpoint is satisfied. If a supply fan fails or trips off, an alarm shall be generated and remaining supply fans shall modulate to maintain static pressure setpoint.
4.	Provide appropriate electrical signal input to volume control devices and necessary devices such as a transducer.
5.	Static pressure controller with its corresponding static pressure sensing station in the supply duct shall modulate supply fan volume control device to maintain the static pressure setpoint.
6.	Static pressure setpoint shall be reset based on the zone requiring the most pressure, i.e. the setpoint is reset 10% (adj) lower until one zone damper is 90% (adj) open. Upon 5% (adj) of zone dampers at 90% open, static pressure setpoint shall be reset up 10%. Static pressure reset shall utilize a 5 minute deadband to allow system to stabilize.
7.	Control Contractor shall work in association with Test and Balance Contractor to determine actual required static pressure setpoints.  The contractors shall adjust supply airflow to maximum flow for all terminal boxes, and then gradually reduce (0.05 wg increments) the static pressure setpoint until at least one terminal box is greater than 90% open and all terminal boxes are meeting their airflow setpoints, then this static pressure shall become the static pressure setpoint for the system.
F.	AHU Staging Control:
1.	Initial AHU start-up sequence enables (1) AHU (AHU with the least cumulative runtime). The 1st lag AHU (fan with next-least cumulative runtime) shall be energized based on duct static pressure.  Whenever static pressure setpoint in the supply duct cannot be maintained with the lead AHU fans operating at 100% (FA) speed for five minutes (FA), the 1st lag AHU shall be energized. The lead AHU fans shall ramp down speed while the lag AHU fans simultaneously increase speed.  Once all AHU fans are operating at the same speed, they shall operate in tandem at the same speed to share the load.  On decreasing load, all AHU fans shall simultaneously slow their speed to maintain differential pressure setpoint at all sensing locations.  If all fans are operating at 40% (FA) speed for five minutes (FA), the AHU with the most accumulated runtime shall be de-energized and valves and control dampers shall modulate to their Off position. The other AHU fans shall operate to maintain static pressure setpoint.
2.	The same sequence shall apply for staging the 2nd lag AHU.
3.	Whenever an AHU is started, it shall operate for a minimum of 15 minutes (FA) before the AHU is allowed to stop.  Whenever an AHU is de-energized, the AHU shall not be enabled to re-start for a minimum of 15 minutes (FA).

4.	Cooling coil control valve shall be closed whenever unit supply fan is not operating or whenever preheat coil valve is open except during a freezestat trip.
5.	During cooling mode, the unit controller shall modulate control valves on wrap-around heat pipe circuits to ensure discharge air temperature downstream of the wrap-around heat pipe does not exceed 60°F (adj).  An alarm shall be signaled through the BAS if wrap-around heat pipe discharge temperature exceeds 60°F (adj).
6.	When preheat valve is open the wrap-around heat pipe control valves shall be closed.
7.	Discharge air dewpoint shall be calculated based on the temperature and relative humidity sensors mounted in the unit downstream of wrap-around heat pipe. This shall be displayed at the BAS, and an alarm shall be generated when the discharge dewpoint rises above the average building dewpoint.
