SPEC 230993- 3.1	LAB FLOW TRACKING ZONE WITH VAV HOOD

General: BAS shall control the air systems in the zone including the supply air reheat terminal (SA) and the variable volume fume hood exhaust valves (VVFH). The flow setpoints on the terminals and valves shall be coordinated and the system shall be controlled to maintain a negative pressure in the room by maintaining the supply flow less than the exhaust, unless the lab is specifically designed as a positive pressure space.
Space Temperature Control: Where multiple thermostats are shown for one room, the thermostats shall control the terminals as designated on the mechanical plans. If multiple terminals are shown connected to a single thermostat the terminals shall all be controlled together to prevent the terminals from providing simultaneous heating and cooling to the same room. Use master/slave arrangement to control multiple terminals with single thermostat, so that damper position and hot water valve position are the same for each of the linked terminals. Refer to Mechanical plans for number and location of thermostats. Coordinate location of thermostat with Engineer if not shown on the plans or the location is in conflict with other equipment.
Five setpoints shall apply. Normal (72°F, adj.), standby heating (67°F), setback heating (65°F, adj.), standby cooling (78°F) and setback cooling (80°F, adj.). These values shall be the only values changed by the operator to adjust space temperatures. All other dead bands, differentials, etc. shall be calculated in the program logic (unless another means is provided to prohibit overlap of the heating and cooling loops and ensure a dead band such as function block templates that restrict the setpoint input).
During the normal periods, separate heating and cooling setpoints shall be calculated.
Normal space cooling setpoint shall be the normal space temperature plus 1.0°F (adj.)
Normal space heating setpoint shall be the normal space temperature minus 1.0°F (adj.)
When ceiling occupancy sensor indicates that a room is vacant during building operating hours or outside of building operating hours the standby heating and cooling setpoint temperatures shall be maintained.
When ceiling occupancy sensor indicates that a room is vacant, outside of building operating hours the setback heating and cooling setpoint temperatures shall be maintained.
When ceiling occupancy sensor indicates that a room is occupied, regardless of the building operating hours, the volume setpoint shall revert to Normal setpoint temperatures.

At no time shall the velocity be below 85 fpm. Actuators shall be capable of, and loop shall be tuned to stabilize (variations less than 10 FPM around the setpoint) within 5 seconds. The flow through the box shall continuously be determined by one of the following two methods:
Direct measurement using a vortex shedding air flow measuring station or
Calibrated valve position from venturi type value
Hood Monitoring Interface: BAS shall continuously monitor the face velocity of the hood and provide a local indication of the status of the hood. Safe conditions shall be set up for 30 percent of the active face velocity setpoint. Local visual and audible indication of unsafe conditions shall be enunciated. Include a silence button.

When the SA Terminal setpoint is dictated by the room exhaust rate, the general exhaust flow rate shall be constant and equal to the minimum airflow as scheduled on the drawings.
When the SA Terminal setpoint is dictated by the space temperature cooling setpoint, the general exhaust flow rate shall be equal to the supply airflow minus the fume hood exhaust airflow minus the equipment exhaust airflow minus the snorkel exhaust airflow plus or minus (based on space pressure relationship) an offset value which shall be determined as follows:

SPEC 230993- 3.3	FACILITY MONITORING SYSTEM (FMS)-LAB CONTROL SEQUENCE

The Laboratory Airflow Control System (LACS) will control the airflow control valves in response to the greatest of three demands:
Temperature control demand
Space exhaust demand
Demand Control Ventilation command from the FMS
The temperature controls and space exhaust controls will operate independent of the FMS and shall override the DCV command when required to maintain thermal comfort and space airflow offset.
The FMS will provide analog proportional DCV signals that correspond to the contaminant levels (TVOC, C02, etc.) sensed within the General Exhaust (GEX) duct probe(s) for each lab as indicated per the following DCV Signal and Differential Contaminant Ranges:

DCV Signal		Min Stpt (adj.)	Max Stpt (adj.)	Units
TVOCs – PID	0.1		1		ppm as isob
TVOCs – MOS	0.3		3		ppm as isob
CO2			300		1000		ppm

When the general exhaust air contains a contaminant (e.g. TVOC, C02, etc) concentration, as sensed by the FMS, that is below minimum setpoint (configured within the LACS) the minimum airflow setpoint within the LACS shall be as scheduled. The actual lab ACH shall be dynamic and equal to the higher of the temperature control demand, the space exhaust demand and the DCV command from the FMS.
When the general exhaust air contains a contaminant concentration, as sensed by the FMS that is above maximum setpoint (configured within the LACS) the minimum airflow setpoint within the LACS shall be reset to the maximum scheduled airflow rates as indicated on the drawings during both occupied and unoccupied hours.
For general exhaust contaminant concentration levels that are between the low and high setpoints, the LACS shall correspondingly and proportionally increase the minimum airflow during both occupied and unoccupied hours.
Once the general exhaust air contains a contaminant concentration, as sensed by the FMS that is below setpoint (configured within the LACS) the minimum airflow setpoint within the LACS shall be reset as described above.
