LAB â€“ SUPPLY, GENERAL EXHAUST, FUME HOOD, CV SNORKEL

GENERAL

1. SPACE TEMPERATURE IS MONITORED BY A SPACE TEMPERATURE SENSOR. SUPPLY AIR DAMPER AND REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE MODULATE TO MAINTAIN SPACE TEMPERATURE.

2. SUPPLY, GENERAL EXHAUST, AND FUME EXHAUST AIR TERMINALS MODULATE AIRFLOW BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM AIR FLOW RATES AND MAINTAIN OFFSET AIRFLOW SETPOINTS AS SCHEDULED.

OCCUPIED MODE:

1. UPON OCCUPIED COMMAND VIA AIR HANDLING UNIT SCHEDULE, PUSHBUTTON OVERRIDE, OR ACTIVATION OF ANY SINGLE ASSOCIATED LIGHTING CONTROLS OCCUPANT SENSOR:

ACTIVATE OCCUPIED TEMPERATURE SETPOINTS.
ACTIVATE OCCUPIED AIRFLOW SETPOINTS.

UNOCCUPIED MODE:

1. UPON UNOCCUPIED COMMAND VIA AIR HANDLING UNIT SCHEDULE, EXPIRATION OF TEMPORARY OVERRIDE, OR DEACTIVATION OF ALL ASSOCIATED LIGHTING CONTROLS OCCUPANT SENSORS:

ACTIVATE UNOCCUPIED TEMPERATURE SETPOINTS.
ACTIVATE UNOCCUPIED AIRFLOW SETPOINTS.

2. TEMPORARY OVERRIDE SHALL FUNCTION WHETHER THE ASSOCIATED AIR HANDLING UNIT IS IN OCCUPIED OR UNOCCUPIED MODE.

3. SUSPEND AIRFLOW SETPOINTS WHEN THE ASSOCIATED AIR HANDLING UNIT IS COMMANDED OFF.

AIRFLOW CONTROL AND TEMPERATURE CONTROL:

1. SUPPLY AIR TERMINAL AND REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT.

2. GENERAL EXHAUST AIR TERMINAL SHALL MODULATE WITH THE SUPPLY AIR TERMINAL TO MAINTAIN ROOM OFFSET.

3. FUME EXHAUST AIR TERMINALS SHALL MODULATE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE FUME HOODS. FUME HOOD AIRFLOW RATES MODULATE BASED ON THE FUME HOOD SASH POSITION FOR EACH HOOD. SUPPLY AIR TERMINAL AND GENERAL EXHAUST AIR TERMINAL SHALL MODULATE AS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ROOM OFFSET.

4. FUME HOOD EXHAUST AIRFLOW MODULATION SHALL TAKE PRECEDENT OVER SPACE TEMPERATURE CONTROL AIRFLOW MODULATION. THE REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE SHALL CONTINUE TO MODULATE TO MAINTAIN SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT.

5. CV SNORKEL SHALL PROVIDE CV EXHAUST. INCLUDE CV SNORKEL EXHAUST INTO TOTAL ROOM EA CALCULATION. 

ALARMS

1. GENERATE ALARM IF SUPPLY AIR DAMPER COMMAND IS AT 100% AND SUPPLY AIRFLOW DOES NOT MEET SETPOINT.

DATA ANALYTICS

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING FAULTS ARE PROVEN TRUE AT ANY TIME, THE BAS SHALL ISSUE A
FAULT REPORT TO THE BAS WORKSTATION STATING THE FAULT NAME AND THE VALUE OF ALL ASSOCIATED BAS POINTS.

1. REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE LEAKING FAULT - REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE IS COMMANDED CLOSED (0%) AND DISCHARGE AIR TEMPERATURE IS 4 DEG F (ADJ) ABOVE ASSOCIATED AHU COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE.
