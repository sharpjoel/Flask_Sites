HEATING HOT WATER - CONTROL SEQUENCE

GENERAL
HOT WATER SYSTEM PROVIDES VARIABLE HOT WATER FLOW AND CONSTANT PRESSURE. EACH
CHILLED WATER PUMP IS SIZED FOR 100% LOAD. PUMPS ARE DESIGNED FOR PRIMARY/REDUNDANT OPERATION.

ACTIVATE START UP SEQUENCE UPON OPERATOR INPUT OR WHEN ANY SINGLE HOT WATER VALVE IS COMMANDED OPEN.

ACTIVATE SHUT DOWN SEQUENCE UPON OPERATOR INPUT OR WHEN ALL HEATING HOT WATER
VALVES ARE COMMANDED CLOSED.

START UP
UPON START COMMAND
LEAD PUMP STARTS AND IS PROVEN
MINIMUM WATER FLOW CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES
DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES
DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE RESET CONTROL SEQUENCE ENABLES
PUMP ROTATION SEQUENCE ACTIVATES

SHUT DOWN
UPON SHUT DOWN COMMAND
PUMPS STOP
MINIMUM FLOW BYPASS VALVE CLOSES
ALL OTHER SEQUENCES DISABLE
SUPPRESS NUISANCE ALARMS

DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CONTROL:
STAGE PUMPS ON AND OFF BASED ON LOAD.

AS DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE RISES ABOVE SETPOINT, LEAD PUMP VFD SPEED DECREASES. MINIMUM VFD SPEED SHALL BE 15 HERTZ (ADJ).

AS DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE FALLS BELOW SETPOINT, THE FOLLOWING OCCURS:

LEAD PUMP VFD SPEED INCREASES TO MAINTAIN DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SETPOINT.
UPON DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE TRANSMITTER FAILURE, PUMP SHALL BE CONTROLLED AT LAST KNOWN SPEED.

DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE RESET:
RESET SEQUENCE IS ONLY ACTIVE WHEN BUILDING SUPPLY TEMPERATURE SETPOINT IS AT MINIMUM. PERFORM EVERY 15 MINUTES (ADJ)
IF ANY VALVE COMMAND IS GREATER THAN 90% (ADJ), INCREASE PRESSURE SETPOINT BY 1 PSID
(ADJ)
IF ALL VALVE COMMANDS ARE LESS THAN 80% (ADJ), DECREASE THE PRESSURE SETPOINT BY 1 PSID (ADJ)

MINIMUM WATER FLOW CONTROL
AS WATER FLOW DECREASES BELOW MINIMUM FLOW SETPOINT, THE MINIMUM FLOW BYPASS VALVEMODULATES OPEN. AS WATER RISES ABOVE MINIMUM FLOW SETPOINT, THE MINIMUM FLOW BYPASS VALVE MODULATES CLOSED.

PUMP ROTATION:
INTEGRATE EXISTING PUMP ROTATION SEQUENCE.

EMERGENCY POWER:
ONLY ONE PUMP SHALL BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE DURING A NORMAL POWER FAILURE. THE USER
SHALL BE ABLE TO SELECT WHICH PUMP OPERATES DURING A NORMAL POWER FAILURE, AND THE
REMAINING PUMP SHALL NOT BE ALLOWED TO START DURING A NORMAL POWER FAILURE.
