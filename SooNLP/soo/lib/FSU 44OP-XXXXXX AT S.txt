OFFICE â€“ 1 SUPPLY


GENERAL

1. SPACE TEMPERATURE IS MONITORED BY A SPACE TEMPERATURE SENSOR. SUPPLY AIR DAMPER AND REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE MODULATE TO MAINTAIN SPACE TEMPERATURE.

OCCUPIED MODE:

1. UPON OCCUPIED COMMAND VIA AIR HANDLING UNIT SCHEDULE, PUSHBUTTON OVERRIDE, OR
ACTIVATION OF ANY SINGLE ASSOCIATED LIGHTING CONTROLS OCCUPANT SENSOR:

ACTIVATE OCCUPIED TEMPERATURE SETPOINTS.
ACTIVATE OCCUPIED AIR FLOW SETPOINTS.

UNOCCUPIED MODE:

1. UPON UNOCCUPIED COMMAND VIA AIR HANDLING UNIT SCHEDULE, EXPIRATION OF TEMPORARY
OVERRIDE, OR DEACTIVATION OF ALL ASSOCIATED LIGHTING CONTROLS OCCUPANT SENSORS:

ACTIVATE UNOCCUPIED TEMPERATURE SETPOINTS.
ACTIVATE UNOCCUPIED AIR FLOW SETPOINTS.

2. TEMPORARY OVERRIDE SHALL FUNCTION WHETHER THE ASSOCIATED AIR HANDLING UNIT IS IN
OCCUPIED OR UNOCCUPIED MODE.

3. SUSPEND AIR FLOW SETPOINTS WHEN THE ASSOCIATED AIR HANDLING UNIT IS COMMANDED OFF.

OCCUPIED TEMPERATURE CONTROL:

1. AS ROOM AIR TEMPERATURE INCREASES ABOVE OCCUPIED SPACE COOLING SETPOINT:

SUPPLY AIRFLOW SETPOINT INCREASES TOWARD SUPPLY MAX. OCCUPIED AIRFLOW SETPOINT.
REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE REMAINS CLOSED.

2. AS ROOM TEMPERATURE DECREASES BELOW OCCUPIED SPACE COOLING SETPOINT:

SUPPLY AIRFLOW SETPOINT DECREASES TOWARD SUPPLY MIN. OCCUPIED AIRFLOW SETPOINT.
REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE REMAINS CLOSED.

3. AS ROOM TEMPERATURE DECREASES BELOW OCCUPIED SPACE HEATING SETPOINT:

SUPPLY AIRFLOW REMAINS AT MIN. OCCUPIED AIRFLOW SETPOINT.
 REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE MODULATES TO MAINTAIN OCCUPIED SPACE HEATING SETPOINT.

4. AS HEATING CONTROL VALVE MODULATES MORE THAN 20% OPEN (ADJ):

AIRFLOW SETPOINT INCREASES TO SUPPLY REHEAT AIRFLOW SETPOINT.
REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE MODULATES TO MAINTAIN OCCUPIED SPACE HEATING SETPOINT.

5. AS ROOM TEMPERATURE INCREASES ABOVE OCCUPIED SPACE HEATING SETPOINT:

REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE MODULATES CLOSED.
SUPPLY AIRFLOW SETPOINT RESETS TO SUPPLY MIN. OCCUPIED AIRFLOW SETPOINT.

UNOCCUPIED TEMPERATURE CONTROL:

1. AS ROOM AIR TEMPERATURE INCREASES ABOVE UNOCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT:

SUPPLY AIRFLOW SETPOINT INCREASES TOWARD SUPPLY MAX. UNOCCUPIED AIRFLOW SETPOINT.
REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE REMAINS CLOSED.

2. AS ROOM TEMPERATURE DECREASES BELOW UNOCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT:
 
SUPPLY AIRFLOW SETPOINT DECREASES TOWARD SUPPLY MIN. UNOCCUPIED SETPOINT.
REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE REMAINS CLOSED.

3. AS ROOM TEMPERATURE DECREASES BELOW UNOCCUPIED HEATING SETPOINT:

SUPPLY AIRFLOW REMAINS AT SUPPLY MIN. UNOCCUPIED SETPOINT.
REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE MODULATES TO MAINTAIN UNOCCUPIED SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT.

4. AS ROOM TEMPERATURE INCREASES ABOVE UNOCCUPIED HEATING SETPOINT:

REHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE MODULATES CLOSED.

ALARMS

1. GENERATE ALARM IF SUPPLY AIR DAMPER COMMAND IS AT 100% AND SUPPLY AIRFLOW DOES NOT MEET SETPOINT.
