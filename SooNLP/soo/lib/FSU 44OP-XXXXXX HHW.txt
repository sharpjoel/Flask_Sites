HEATING HOT WATER - CONTROL SEQUENCE

GENERAL

HOT WATER SYSTEM PROVIDES VARIABLE HOT WATER FLOW AND CONSTANT PRESSURE. EACH CHILLED WATER PUMP IS SIZED FOR 100% LOAD. PUMPS ARE DESIGNED FOR PRIMARY/REDUNDANT OPERATION.
ACTIVATE START UP SEQUENCE UPON OPERATOR INPUT OR WHEN ANY SINGLE HOT WATER VALVE IS COMMANDED OPEN.
ACTIVATE SHUT DOWN SEQUENCE UPON OPERATOR INPUT OR WHEN ALL HEATING HOT WATER VALVES ARE COMMANDED CLOSED.

START UP

UPON START COMMAND

LEAD PUMP STARTS AND IS PROVEN
MINIMUM WATER FLOW CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES
DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES
DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE RESET CONTROL SEQUENCE ENABLES
PUMP ROTATION SEQUENCE ACTIVATES

SHUT DOWN

UPON SHUT DOWN COMMAND

PUMPS STOP
MINIMUM FLOW BYPASS VALVE CLOSES
ALL OTHER SEQUENCES DISABLE
SUPPRESS NUISANCE ALARMS

DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CONTROL:

STAGE PUMPS ON AND OFF BASED ON LOAD.
AS DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE RISES ABOVE SETPOINT:

LEAD PUMP VFD SPEED DECREASES. MINIMUM VFD SPEED SHALL BE 15
HERTZ (ADJ).

3. AS DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE FALLS BELOW SETPOINT, THE FOLLOWING OCCURS:

 LEAD PUMP VFD SPEED INCREASES TO MAINTAIN DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SETPOINT.
UPON DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE TRANSMITTER FAILURE, PUMP SHALL BE CONTROLLED AT LAST KNOWN SPEED.

DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE RESET:

RESET SEQUENCE IS ONLY ACTIVE WHEN BUILDING SUPPLY TEMPERATURE SETPOINT IS AT MINIMUM.
PERFORM EVERY 15 MINUTES (ADJ)
IF ANY VALVE COMMAND IS GREATER THAN 90% (ADJ), INCREASE PRESSURE SETPOINT BY 1 PSID (ADJ)
4. IF ALL VALVE COMMANDS ARE LESS THAN 80% (ADJ), DECREASE THE PRESSURE SETPOINT BY 1 PSID (ADJ)

PUMP ROTATION:

UPON ROTATION COMMAND, ONCE PER WEEK (ADJ) OR UPON OPERATOR INPUT:

DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CONTROL SEQUENCE REMAINS ACTIVE
STANDBY PUMP GRADUALLY RAMPS UP TO 20 HERTZ (ADJ) AND HOLDS
LEAD PUMP GRADUALLY RAMPS DOWN AND TURNS OFF
LEAD/STANDBY DESIGNATIONS ROTATE AND ARE ASSIGNED IN ORDER OF

RUN HOURS. THE PUMP WITH THE LOWEST NUMBER OF RUN HOURS SHALL
BE DESIGNATED AS THE LEAD PUMP.

EMERGENCY POWER:
ONLY ONE PUMP SHALL BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE DURING A NORMAL POWER FAILURE. THE USER SHALL BE ABLE TO SELECT WHICH PUMP OPERATES DURING A NORMAL POWER FAILURE, AND THE REMAINING PUMP SHALL NOT BE ALLOWED TO START DURING A NORMAL POWER FAILURE.


STEAM - CONTROL SEQUENCE

GENERAL

1. STEAM SYSTEM PROVIDES PRIMARY HEAT SOURCE FOR HEATING HOT WATER PRODUCTION.

2. ACTIVATE START UP SEQUENCE UPON OPERATOR INPUT OR WHEN ANY SINGLE HOT WATER VALVE IS COMMANDED OPEN.

3. ACTIVATE SHUT DOWN SEQUENCE UPON OPERATOR INPUT OR WHEN ALL HEATING HOT WATER VALVES ARE COMMANDED CLOSED.

START UP

1. UPON START COMMAND

HEAT EXCHANGER ISOLATION VALVE OPENS.
PRV PRESSURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
TEMPERATURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
BUILDING SUPPLY TEMPERATURE RESET CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.

SHUT DOWN

1. UPON SHUT DOWN COMMAND

STEAM CONTROL VALVE CLOSES AND IS PROVEN.
HEAT EXCHANGER ISOLATION VALVE CLOSES.
ALL OTHER SEQUENCES DISABLE.
SUPPRESS NUISANCE ALARMS.

PRV PRESSURE CONTROL

1. PRESSURE REGULATING VALVE MODULATES TO MAINTAIN LOW PRESSURE STEAM PRESSURE SETPOINT.

TEMPERATURE CONTROL

1. STEAM CONTROL VALVE ASSOCIATED WITH HEAT EXCHANGER MODULATES TO MAINTAIN BUILDING SUPPLY HEATING HOT WATER TEMPERATURE.

2. HEAT EXCHANGER HOT WATER ISOLATION VALVES SHALL OPEN AS THE STEAM CONTROL VALVE MODULATES OPEN. TUNE THE ISOLATION VALVE OPENING AND CLOSING RATES TO ENSURE STABLE SYSTEM OPERATION.

BUILDING SUPPLY TEMPERATURE RESET:

1. RESET THE BUILDING SUPPLY TEMPERATURE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE:

IF 100% (ADJ) OF HEATING CONTROL VALVES HAVE A VALVE COMMAND AT 40% (ADJ) OR LESS: DECREASE BUILDING SUPPLY TEMPERATURE 1 DEG F EVERY 10 MINUTES (ADJ) TO A MINIMUM OF 90 DEGREES (ADJ).
BUILDING SUPPLY TEMPERATURE RESET STOPS WHEN ANY HEATING CONTROL VALVE COMMAND IS 80% OR GREATER (ADJ)
IF ANY HEATING CONTROL VALVE COMMAND IS 90% OR GREATER (ADJ): INCREASE BUILDING SUPPLY TEMPERATURE 1 DEG F EVERY 10 MINUTES (ADJ) TO A MAXIMUM OF 200 DEGREES (ADJ).

HEAT EXCHANGER SHUTDOWN

1. UPON SHUT DOWN OF UNIT, SHUT THE STEAM CONTROL VALVES AND HOT WATER ISOLATION VALVE.

SAFETIES

1. HOT WATER ISOLATION VALVES SHALL NOT CLOSE UNLESS THE CORRESPONDING STEAM CONTROL VALVE IS PROVEN CLOSED.


CONDENSATE PUMP 
CONTROL SEQUENCE

CONDENSATE PUMPS SHALL USED PACKAGED CONTROLS. BAS SHALL MONITOR POINTS INDICATED AND ISSUE ALARMS.
