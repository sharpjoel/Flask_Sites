100% OUTSIDE AIR UNIT - CONTROL SEQUENCE
AHU 4-1

GENERAL:
VARIABLE AIR VOLUME 100% OA AIR HANDLING SYSTEM DISTRIBUTES AIR TO VAV AIR TERMINAL UNITS.

SYSTEM OPERATION:
SYSTEM SHALL OPERATE CONTINUOUSLY (24 HOURS PER DAY, 365 DAYS PER YEAR).

SYSTEM SHALL RESTART AUTOMATICALLY ONCE NORMAL POWER IS AVAILABLE DURING A POWER OUTAGE.

START UP:
UPON START UP COMMAND:

ALL SUPPLY AND EXHAUST FIRE/SMOKE AND SMOKE DAMPERS IN SYSTEM SHALL OPEN AND BE PROVEN (HARDWIRE INTERLOCK TO VFD RUN PERMISSIVE).
OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER SHALL OPEN AND BE PROVEN (HARDWIRE INTERLOCK TO VFD RUN PERMISSIVE).
SUPPLY FAN VFD SHALL START SUPPLY FANS; OPERATION OF VFD (VIA COMM BUS) AND EACH FAN (VIA CURRENT SWITCH) SHALL BE PROVEN.
SUPPLY FAN STATIC PRESSURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
SUPPLY DUCT STATIC PRESSURE RESET ACTIVATES.
PRECONDITIONING COIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
COOLING COIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE RESET SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.

SHUTDOWN:
UPON SHUTDOWN COMMAND:

ALL SUPPLY FANS SHALL STOP AND BE PROVEN BY CURRENT SENSING DEVICES.
ALL ASSOCIATED SUPPLY AND EXHAUST FIRE/SMOKE AND SMOKE DAMPERS IN
SYSTEM SHALL CLOSE AND BE PROVEN (END SWITCH FEEDBACK).
OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER SHALL CLOSE AND BE PROVEN (END SWITCH FEEDBACK).
ALL OTHER SEQUENCES DISABLE.
NUISANCE ALARMS ARE SUPPRESSED.

SUPPLY FAN STATIC PRESSURE CONTROL:
VFD CONTROLS THE SUPPLY FAN SPEED. SUPPLY FAN VFD SPEED MODULATES TO MAINTAIN SUPPLY DUCT STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT.

SUPPLY DUCT STATIC PRESSURE RESET:
PERFORM EVERY 15 MINUTES (ADJ). 
IF ANY VAV BOX DAMPER COMMAND IS GREATER THAN 90% (ADJ), INCREASE DUCT STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT BY 0.1 IN.WG.
IF ALL VAV BOX DAMPER COMMANDS ARE LESS THAN 60% (ADJ), DECREASE DUCT STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT BY 0.1 IN.WG.

COOLING COIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL:
COOLING COIL VALVE MODULATES TO MAINTAIN COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR SETPOINT.

COOLING COIL TEMPERATURE RESET CONTROL:
RESET SEQUENCE IS ONLY ACTIVE WHEN STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT IS AT MINIMUM.
RESET THE COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE SETPOINT BASED ON THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE:

50% (ADJ) OF THE ZONES SERVED HAVE A REHEAT VALVE COMMAND AT 75% (ADJ) OR HIGHER: INCREASE LAT 1 DEG F EVERY 10 MINUTES (ADJ) UNTIL 75% (ADJ) OF ZONE REHEAT COIL COMMANDS ARE BELOW 65% (ADJ).

75% (ADJ) OF THE ZONES SERVED HAVE A REHEAT VALVE COMMAND AT 25% (ADJ) OR LOWER: DECREASE LAT 1 DEG F EVERY 10 MINUTES (ADJ) UNTIL 50% (ADJ) OF ZONE REHEAT COIL COMMANDS ARE ABOVE 35% (ADJ).

COOLING COIL TEMPERATURE RESET STOPS WHEN ANY ZONE HUMIDITY SENSOR MEASURES 50% RH OR GREATER.

PRECONDITIONING COIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL:
BASE BID: 
HEATING HOT WATER TEMPERATURE CONTROL VALVE MODULATES TO MAINTAIN PREHEAT LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE SETPOINT.

LEAD/STANDBY ROTATION FOR PRIMARY/REDUNDANT VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVES:

AUTOMATICALLY ROTATE LEAD/STANDBY DESIGNATIONS FOR DRIVE A AND DRIVE B EACH WEEK TO EQUALIZE RUN TIME.

LEAD/STANDBY ROTATION SHALL PROVIDE SEAMLESS TRANSITION FROM DRIVE A TO DRIVE B WITHOUT ANY LOSS OF AIR FLOW.

OPERATOR SHALL BE ABLE TO MANUALLY OVERRIDE LEAD/STANDBY DESIGNATIONS.

SAFETIES:
IF ALL OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUR, THE COOLING COIL CONTROL VALVE SHALL MODULATE TO 100% (ADJ) OPEN:

THE HEATING HOT WATER CONTROL VALVE IS 100% OPEN.
THE PRECONDITIONING COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE IS 38 DEG F OR LESS (ADJ) AT FULL FLOW THROUGH THE COIL

THE FOLLOWING SAFETIES SHUT DOWN SUPPLY FAN AND ACTIVATE SHUT DOWN SEQUENCE:

LOW TEMPERATURE LIMIT SWITCH
LOW STATIC PRESSURE LIMIT SWITCH
HIGH STATIC PRESSURE LIMIT SWITCH
SUPPLY ISOLATION SMOKE DAMPER END SWITCH
DRAIN PAN FLOAT SWITCH ALARM

SYSTEM SHALL CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN NORMAL MODE IF THE BUILDING FIRE ALARM IS ACTIVATED.

UPON ACTIVATION OF DUCT SMOKE DETECTOR ASSOCIATED WITH THE AIR HANDLING UNIT, ACTIVATE SHUTDOWN SEQUENCE.
