MIXED AIR UNIT - CONTROL SEQUENCE

GENERAL:

1. VARIABLE AIR VOLUME (VAV) RE-CIRCULATING AIR HANDLING SYSTEM DISTRIBUTES AIR TO VAV
AIR TERMINAL UNITS

2. SYSTEM OPERATION:

OCCUPIED MODE OCCURS MON TO FRI 7AM TO 6PM (ADJ). TIME OUTSIDE OF THIS PERIOD SHALL BE DESIGNATED AS UNOCCUPIED MODE.
START UP SEQUENCE ACTIVATES AT A TIME DETERMINED BY OPTIMUM START FUNCTION.
OVERRIDE OF UNOCCUPIED MODE IS ACCOMPLISHED BY ACTIVATION OF ANY SINGLE
PUSHBUTTON OVERRIDE SWITCH AT ZONE LEVEL; REFER ROOM TYPE CONTROL SEQUENCES.

3. SYSTEM SHALL RESTART AUTOMATICALLY ACCORDING TO TIME-OF-DAY SCHEDULE ONCE NORMAL POWER IS RESTORED FOLLOWING A POWER OUTAGE.

START UP:

1. UPON START UP COMMAND:

RETURN AIR DAMPER OPENS FULLY.
SUPPLY FAN VFD STARTS SUPPLY FAN(S); VFD AND EACH FAN ARE PROVEN.
EXHAUST FAN STARTS AND IS PROVEN.
RELIEF FAN VFD STARTS RETURN FAN; VFD AND FAN ARE PROVEN.
RELIEF FAN CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
SUPPLY STATIC PRESSURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
SUPPLY FAN STATIC PRESSURE RESET SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
COOLING COIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE RESET SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
OUTSIDE AIR CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.

OCCUPIED:

1. UPON OCCUPIED COMMAND:

START UP SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
SPACE OCCUPIED SETPOINTS ARE ACTIVATED.

UNOCCUPIED:

1. UPON UNOCCUPIED COMMAND, VIA SCHEDULE OR OPERATOR, THE FOLLOWING OCCURS:

SHUT DOWN SEQUENCE ACTIVATES
SPACE UNOCCUPIED SETPOINTS ARE ACTIVATED
OUTSIDE AIR CONTROL SEQUENCE DEACTIVATES AND DAMPER CLOSES.

2. IF 25% OF ZONE TEMPERATURE/HUMIDITY SENSORS VARY FROM SETPOINT, THE FOLLOWING
OCCURS:

START UP SEQUENCE ACTIVATES AND UNIT OPERATES FOR A DURATION EQUAL TO THE MINIMUM RUN TIME SETPOINT
ASSOCIATED EXHAUST DAMPER(S) REMAIN CLOSED AND EXHAUST FAN(S) REMAIN OFF.
ASSOCIATED OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER REMAINS CLOSED

3. AS ZONE TEMPERATURE/HUMIDITY IS SATISFIED, THE FOLLOWING OCCURS:

SHUT DOWN SEQUENCE ACTIVATES

SHUT DOWN:

1. UPON SHUT DOWN COMMAND:

SUPPLY FANS STOP.
OUTSIDE AIR DAMPERS CLOSE.
COOLING COIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL SEQUENCE DEACTIVATES AND VALVE CLOSES.
ALL OTHER SEQUENCES DISABLE.
ASSOCIATED EXHAUST FAN(S) STOP AND EXHAUST DAMPER(S) CLOSE.
NUISANCE ALARMS ARE SUPPRESSED.

SUPPLY FAN STATIC PRESSURE CONTROL:

1. VFD CONTROLS THE SUPPLY FAN SPEED.

2. SUPPLY FAN VFD SPEED MODULATES TO MAINTAIN SUPPLY DUCT STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT.

SUPPLY DUCT STATIC PRESSURE RESET:

1. PERFORM EVERY 15 MINUTES (ADJ)

2. IF ANY VAV BOX DAMPER COMMAND IS GREATER THAN 90% (ADJ), INCREASE DUCT STATIC
PRESSURE SETPOINT BY 0.1 IN.WG.

3. IF ALL VAV BOX DAMPER COMMANDS ARE LESS THAN 60% (ADJ), DECREASE DUCT STATIC
PRESSURE SETPOINT BY 0.1 IN.WG.

RELIEF FAN CONTROL:

1. VFD CONTROLS RETURN FAN SPEED.

2. RELIEF FAN VFD SPEED MODULATES TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT OFFSET BETWEEN OUTSIDE
AIRFLOW AND RELIEF AIRFLOW. RELIEF AIR FLOW SETPOINT SHALL BE DETERMINED USING
THE FOLLOWING FORMULA:

RELIEF AIR FLOW SETPOINT = MEASURED OUTSIDE AIR FLOW - OFFSET AIRFLOW SETPOINT
OFFSET AIRFLOW SETPOINT = 750 CFM

PRECOOLING COIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL:

1. PRECOOLING COIL VALVE MODULATES TO MAINTAIN PRECOOLING COIL LEAVING AIR
SETPOINT.

PREHEAT COIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL:

1. PREHEAT COIL VALVE MODULATES TO MAINTAIN PREHEAT COIL LEAVING AIR SETPOINT.

COOLING COIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL:

1. COOLING COIL VALVE MODULATES TO MAINTAIN COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR SETPOINT.

SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE RESET CONTROL:

1. RESET SEQUENCE IS ONLY ACTIVE WHEN STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT IS AT MINIMUM.

2. RESET THE COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE (LAT) BASED ON THE FOLLOWING
SCHEDULE:

50% (ADJ) OF THE ZONES SERVED HAVE A REHEAT VALVE COMMAND AT 75% (ADJ) OR HIGHER: INCREASE LAT 1 DEG F EVERY 10 MINUTES (ADJ) UNTIL 75% (ADJ) OF ZONE REHEAT COIL COMMANDS ARE BELOW 65% (ADJ)
75% (ADJ) OF THE ZONES SERVED HAVE A REHEAT VALVE COMMAND AT 25% (ADJ) OR LOWER: DECREASE LAT 1 DEG F EVERY 10 MINUTES (ADJ) UNTIL 50% (ADJ) OF ZONE REHEAT COIL COMMANDS ARE ABOVE 35% (ADJ)

3. SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE RESET STOPS WHEN ANY ZONE HUMIDITY SENSOR MEASURES 50%
RH OR GREATE

OUTSIDE AIR CONTROL:

1. OUTSIDE AIR VOLUME CONTROL:

OUTSIDE AIR FAN MODULATES TO MAINTAIN OUTSIDE AIRFLOW SETPOINT.

SAFETIES:

1. IF THE PREHEAT COIL VALVE IS 100% OPEN AND THE PREHEAT LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE IS
38 DEG F OR LESS (ADJ), PRECOOLING COIL CONTROL VALVE SHALL MODULATE TO 100% (ADJ)
OPEN.

2. IF THE MIXED AIR TEMPERATURE FALLS BELOW 38 DEG F, UNIT SHALL SHUT DOWN.

2. THE FOLLOWING SAFETIES SHUT DOWN SUPPLY FAN AND ACTIVATE SHUT DOWN SEQUENCE:

TEMPERATURE LOW LIMIT
LOW RETURN AIR STATIC PRESSURE
HIGH SUPPLY AIR STATIC PRESSURE
ISOLATION DAMPER END SWITCH
DRAIN PAN FLOAT SWITCH ALARM
