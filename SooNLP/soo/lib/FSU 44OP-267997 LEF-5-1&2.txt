LABORATORY EXHAUST FAN SYSTEM - CONTROL SEQUENCE

GENERAL:
FUME EXHAUST SYSTEM CONSIST OF 2 EXHAUST FANS CONNECTED TO A COMMON PLENUM.
EACH FAN IS SIZED TO HANDLE TOTAL DESIGN LOAD. SYSTEM SHALL OPERATE 24 HOURS A DAY,
365 DAYS A YEAR WITH BOTH FANS OPERATING CONTINUOUSLY.

FLOW THROUGH EXHAUST FAN SHALL BE CONSTANT VOLUME WHILE THE BUILDING EXHAUST
FLOW IS VARIABLE VOLUME.

EACH FUME EXHAUST FAN HAS ITS OWN INDIVIDUAL AUTOMATIC ISOLATION DAMPER. ISOLATION DAMPER SHALL BE OPENED WHENEVER ASSOCIATED FAN IS SIGNALED TO START, AND
CLOSED WHENEVER FAN IS SIGNALED TO STOP. ISOLATION DAMPER SHALL CLOSE ONLY AFTER
FAN COMPLETELY STOPS. EXHAUST FAN SHALL NOT START UNTIL ITS ASSOCIATED ISOLATION
DAMPER IS COMMANDED OPEN.

SYSTEM OPERATION:
START UP SEQUENCE ACTIVATES ANY TIME THE START UP SEQUENCE ACTIVATES FOR THE
ASSOCIATED AIR HANDLING UNIT.

FANS SHALL RESTART AUTOMATICALLY ONCE NORMAL POWER IS RESTORED FOLLOWING A
POWER OUTAGE.

START UP:
UPON START UP COMMAND:
LEAD OUTSIDE AIR BYPASS DAMPER OPENS TO 30% (ADJ).
FAN ISOLATION DAMPERS OPEN AND ARE PROVEN.
EXHAUST FAN VFDS STARTS EXHAUST FANS AND SLOWLY RAMP FANS UP TO 20 HERTZ (ADJ); VFDS AND FANS ARE PROVEN.
EXHAUST FAN STATIC PRESSURE CONTROL SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.
EXHAUST FAN VFDS RAMPS FAN SPEEDS IN UNISON UP TO NORMAL OPERATING SETPOINT.
NORMAL OPERATING SETPOINT SHALL BE DETERMINED BY TEST AND BALANCE.
FAN FAILURE SEQUENCE ACTIVATES.

SHUT DOWN:
UPON SHUT DOWN COMMAND:
EXHAUST FANS STOPS.
OUTSIDE AIR BYPASS DAMPERS CLOSE.
FAN ISOLATION DAMPERS CLOSE.
ALL OTHER SEQUENCES DISABLE.
NUISANCE ALARMS ARE SUPPRESSED.

EXHAUST FAN STATIC PRESSURE CONTROL:
MODULATE OUTSIDE AIR BYPASS DAMPERS TO MAINTAIN EXHAUST DUCT STATIC PRESSURE
SETPOINT. STAGE OUTSIDE AIR BYPASS DAMPERS OPEN INDIVIDUALLY.

LEAD BYPASS DAMPER SHALL MODULATE TO 80% (ADJ) OPEN BEFORE THE LAG DAMPER
BEGINS TO OPEN.

LAG DAMPER OPENS TO 40% (ADJ) AND LEAD DAMPER MODULATES TO MATCH.

BOTH DAMPERS MODULATE IN UNISON TO MAINTAIN STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT.

IF BOTH DAMPERS REMAIN AT 20% (ADJ) OR LESS FOR 3 MINUTES (ADJ) OR MORE, CLOSE LAG
DAMPER AND MODULATE LEAD DAMPER TO 40% (ADJ). ONCE LAG DAMPER CLOSES AND IS
PROVEN, LEAD DAMPER MODULATES TO MAINTAIN STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT.

BYPASS DAMPERS SHALL NOT MODULATE TO LESS THAN 10% (ADJ) OPEN. THE MINIMUM VFD
SPEED SHALL MAINTAIN THE STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT WHEN THE BYPASS DAMPER IS AT
ITS MINIMUM POSITION.

ROTATE LEAD/LAG DAMPER DESIGNATIONS EVERY WEEK (ADJ).
FAN FAILURE:
UPON FAILURE OF ANY FAN, OR UPON LOSS OF OPEN STATUS OF A FAN ISOLATION DAMPER,
CLOSE THE ASSOCIATED FAN ISOLATION DAMPER AND COMMAND FAN OFF.

EXHAUST FAN VFD FOR THE REMAINING FAN SHALL MODULATE FAN SPEED TO THE MAXIMUM
OPERATING SETPOINT.

UPON MANUAL INPUT BY OPERATOR TO REACTIVATE THE FAILED FAN:
EXHAUST FAN VFD STARTS EXHAUST FAN AT 20 HERTZ (ADJ); VFD AND FAN ARE PROVEN.
FAN ISOLATION DAMPER OPENS AND IS PROVEN.
EXHAUST FAN VFDS MODULATE ALL FAN SPEEDS TO NORMAL OPERATING SETPOINT.

SAFETIES:
THE FOLLOWING SAFETIES SHUT DOWN EXHAUST FANS AND ACTIVATE SHUT DOWN SEQUENCE:

LOW EXHAUST STATIC PRESSURE
IF ASSOCIATED AIR HANDLER SHUTS DOWN, OPEN EXISTING SIDEWALL OUTSIDE AIR DAMPERS (MANUAL). EXHAUST FAN WILL CONTINUE RUNNING.
