AIR HANDLING UNIT AHU-1 SEQUENCE OF OPERATION

SYSTEM START-UP
THE SYSTEM SHALL BE AUTOMATICALLY STARTED AND STOPPED BY THE BCS CONTROLLERS WHENEVER THE HAND-OFF-AUTO SWITCH IS IN THE AUTOMATIC POSITION, AND MANUALLY STARTED AND STOPPED BY THE HAND AND OFF POSITIONS. DURING AUTOMATIC OPERATION, THE SYSTEM SHALL RUN AT ALL TIMES. PRIOR TO FAN STARTING, ALL MOTORIZED VALVES AND DAMPERS SHALL BE RELEASED TO NORMAL CONTROL.

COOLING COIL CONTROL
MODULATE THE CHILLED WATER VALVE TO MAINTAIN COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE SETPOINT, INITIALLY SET TO 52 DEG F (ADJ).

SETPOINT VARIATION: IF THE FAN VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVE IS OPERATING AT MINIMUM SPEED, SPACE RELATIVE HUMIDITY IS LESS THAN 47%, AND SPACE TEMPERATURE DROPS BELOW COOLING SETPOINT, RAISE COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE SETPOINT BY 0.5 DEG F EVERY TEN MINUTES TO A MAXIMUM OF 70 DEG F. IF SPACE TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE COOLING SETPOINT, LOWER COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE SETPOINT BY 1 DEG F EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

HUMIDITY OVERRIDE: IF RETURN AIR RELATIVE HUMIDITY INCREASES ABOVE 55%, IMMEDIATELY RESET COOLING COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE SETPOINT TO 52 DEG F. EXIT OVERRIDE MODE ONCE RELATIVE HUMIDITY DROPS BELOW 50%.

ELECTRIC HEAT CONTROL
MODULATE THE ELECTRIC HEAT SCR CONTROLS TO MAINTAIN PREHEAT COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE SETPOINT, INITIALLY SET TO 75 DEG F.

SUPPLY FAN CONTROL
MODULATE THE SUPPLY FAN VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVE TO MAINTAIN COOLING SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT, INITIALLY SET TO 75 DEG F.

REHEAT CONTROL
MODULATE THE HC-1 SCR CONTROLS TO MAINTAIN HEATING SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT, INITIALLY SET TO 70 DEG F.

OUTSIDE AIR CONTROL
MODULATE THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER TO MAINTAIN THE OUTSIDE AIRFLOW SETPOINT AS MEASURED BY THE OUTDOOR AIR FLOW MEASUREMENT SYSTEM. IF OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER IS FULLY OPEN AND SETPOINT CANNOT BE MAINTAINED, MODULATE THE RETURN AIR DAMPER TOWARDS THE CLOSED POSITION TO MAINTAIN SETPOINT.

FREEZE PROTECTION
LOW LIMIT SAFETY SENSING AIR ENTERING THE COOLING COIL SHALL BE SET AT 40 DEG D (ADJ). IF LOW TEMPERATURE LIMIT IS TRIPPED, STOP THE FAN, CLOSE THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER, AND OPEN THE CHILLED WATER VALVE.

HIGH PRESSURE SAFETY
A HIGH PRESSURE SAFETY SENSING DISCHARGE STATIC PRESSURE SET AT 2.0 WG SHALL STOP THE FAN.

LOW PRESSURE SAFETY
A LOW PRESSURE SAFETY SENSING INLET STATIC PRESSURE SET AT -2.0 WG SHALL STOP THE FAN.

SHUTDOWN

ON A CONTROLLED FAN SHUTDOWN (AT THE HOA SWITCH, THROUGH THE BCS, OR ON A SIGNAL FROM THE FIRE ALARM SYSTEM,) OR UPON FAN SHUTDOWN DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE, LOW PRESSURE, OR LOW LIMIT SAFETY ACTIVATION, THE OUTSIDE AIR, RELIEF, RETURN DAMPERS, AND CHILLED WATER VALVES SHALL CLOSE.

FIRE ALARM SYSTEM
ON ACTIVATION OF THE FIRE ALARM SYSTEM RELAY, THE SYSTEM SHALL SHUT DOWN.
